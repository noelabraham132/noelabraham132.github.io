                            The Toyota RAV4 is practical, fuel-efficient, and rugged-looking. 
                            It offers plenty of features and its wide price range suits shoppers of many budgets.
                        </p>

                            The Tesla Model Y handling is less spry, leading to a clumsy feeling in corners and making it less fun to hustle. 
                            But its cabin is roomier, and its cargo area is more accommodating.

                            The Honda CR-V offers reliably good performance, with plenty of usable space, friendly driving dynamics, front- or all-wheel drive, 
                            a 190-hp turbocharged engine, and an optional 204-hp hybrid version.

                            The Toyota Camry is popular for its affordability, spaciousness, and efficiency.
                            The interior has been revamped with more modern infotainment tech and styling inspired by the larger Crown sedan, 
                            but the Camry remains a mid-size car intent on challenging competitors.

                            The Nissan Rogue not only has a smooth ride quality, but it also boasts some of the comfiest seats to ever cushion our backsides. 
                            The Rogue's interior is also quite nice, with attractive materials and modern tech.

                            The Toyota Corolla isn't here to excite. Instead, it offers a safe predictable ride no matter how far the trip is. 
                            Performance isn't at the forefront of the Corolla's intentions.

                            Jeep Wrangler is an SUV that will take you just about anywhere you want to go. 
                            Jeep has come a long way from its military roots and offers plenty of creature comforts, and in fact, higher-end trims could be called luxurious.
