                <u>About Cars</u>
            </h2>
            <p id="paragraph-about-cars">
                A car, or an automobile, is a motor vehicle with wheels. 
                Most definitions of cars state that they run primarily on roads, seat one to eight people, have four wheels, and mainly transport people, not cargo. 
                French inventor Nicolas-Joseph Cugnot built the first steam-powered road vehicle in 1769, while French-born Swiss inventor François Isaac de Rivaz designed and constructed the first internal combustion-powered automobile in 1808. 
                The modern car—a practical, marketable automobile for everyday use—was invented in 1886, when German inventor Carl Benz patented his Benz Patent-Motorwagen. 
                Commercial cars became widely available during the 20th century. 
                One of the first cars affordable by the masses was the 1908 Model T an American car manufactured by the Ford Motor Company. 
                Cars were rapidly adopted in the US, where they replaced horse-drawn carriages. 
                In Europe and other parts of the world, demand for automobiles did not increase until after World War II. 
                The car is considered an essential part of the developed economy.
                Cars have controls for driving, parking, passenger comfort, and a variety of lamps. 
                Over the decades, additional features and controls have been added to vehicles, making them progressively more complex. 
                These include rear-reversing cameras, air conditioning, navigation systems, and in-car entertainment. 
                Most cars in use in the early 2020s are propelled by an internal combustion engine, fueled by the combustion of fossil fuels. 
                Electric cars, which were invented early in the history of the car, became commercially available in the 2000s and are predicted to cost less to buy than petrol-driven cars before 2025. 
                The transition from fossil fuel-powered cars to electric cars features prominently in most climate change mitigation scenarios, such as Project Drawdown's 100 actionable solutions for climate change.

            <h2>
                <u>History of Cars</u>
            </h2>
            <p id="info-about-history-of-cars">
                The first steam-powered vehicle was designed by Ferdinand Verbiest, a Flemish member of a Jesuit mission in China around 1672. 
                It was a 65-centimetre-long (26 in) scale-model toy for the Kangxi Emperor that was unable to carry a driver or a passenger. 
                It is not known with certainty if Verbiest's model was successfully built or run.
                Nicolas-Joseph Cugnot is widely credited with building the first full-scale, self-propelled mechanical vehicle in about 1769; he created a steam-powered tricycle. 
                He also constructed two steam tractors for the French Army, one of which is preserved in the French National Conservatory of Arts and Crafts. 
                His inventions were limited by problems with water supply and maintaining steam pressure.
                In 1801, Richard Trevithick built and demonstrated his Puffing Devil road locomotive, believed by many to be the first demonstration of a steam-powered road vehicle. 
                It was unable to maintain sufficient steam pressure for long periods and was of little practical use.
                In 1892, German engineer Rudolf Diesel was granted a patent for a "New Rational Combustion Engine". 
                In 1897, he built the first diesel engine. Steam-, electric-, and petrol-driven vehicles competed for a few decades, with petrol internal combustion engines achieving dominance in the 1910s. 
                Although various pistonless rotary engine designs have attempted to compete with the conventional piston and crankshaft design, only Mazda's version of the Wankel engine has had more than very limited success. 
                All in all, it is estimated that over 100,000 patents created the modern automobile.

            Here are some advantages for two types of cars:
            <table>
                <thead>
                    <th>
                        <u>
                            <h3>SEDAN</h3>
                        </u>

                    <th>

                            <h3>SUV</h3>

                    </th>
                </thead>

                    <tr>
                        <td>
                            <u><b>Space</b></u>: Whether you're taking the whole family from Naperville to Aurora or loading up on cargo in Bolingbrook, you'll find substantially more space in an SUV. That means more room to stretch out and relax and more space for storage.
                        </td>
                        <td>
                            <u><b>Fuel Economy</b></u>: Most sedans are available with an entry-level four-cylinder or an available V6. Whichever you choose, expect to make better fuel economy ratings than you would in an SUV.
                        </td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>
                            <u><b>Capability</b></u>: A few sedans are available with all-wheel drive, but the option of a strong AWD system is a prerequisite for most SUVs. If you're likely to experience less-than-perfect weather, an SUV might make sense.
                        </td>
                        <td>
                            <u><b>Drivability</b></u>: Sedans aren't as large as SUVs. Some people might see that as a disadvantage, but keep in mind that smaller vehicles are easier to maneuver and park.
                        </td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>
                            <u><b>Ride Height</b></u>: Even smaller SUVs put you higher above the road than a sedan. That means enjoying superior outward visibility, and it's always nice to be riding higher than other drivers.
                        </td>
                        <td>
                            <u><b>Budget</b></u>: In general, sedans aren't as expensive as SUVs, so you can either save some money or put it towards a higher trim level with the latest features.
                        </td>
